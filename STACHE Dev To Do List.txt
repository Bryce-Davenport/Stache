STACHE – Dev To-Do List

=== ITEMS ===
[ ] Add "Edit Item" page
    - Route: GET/POST /items/<item_id>/edit
    - Prefill form with existing item data
    - Reuse Add Item form styling
[ ] Add "Delete Item" button
    - Place on Edit Item page (similar to Delete Stache)
    - POST /items/<item_id>/delete
    - Confirm dialog before delete
[ ] Allow moving an item to a different Stache
    - In Edit Item form, Stache dropdown shows all staches
    - Changing selection updates item.stache_id

=== STACHES / ITEMS UX ===
[ ] From Stache detail page, show items belonging to that stache (already working – sanity check)
[ ] Add "New Item" from Stache detail
    - Optional: preselect Stache in Add Item form using query param (?stache_id=...)
[ ] Make sure delete flows don’t break when there are 0 items / 0 staches

=== FILTERS & SEARCH ===
[ ] Implement basic sorting for staches and items
    - Sort by name A–Z / Z–A
    - Sort by recently created (using created_at if available, or add it)
[ ] Implement simple text search
    - Search box on Items page
    - Filter by item name, category, location, tags
[ ] Wire up “Quick filters” section
    - For now, make hardcoded filters (e.g., category = "Shelter", tag = "electronics")

=== PROJECTS / TO-DOS ===
[ ] Design minimal Projects data model in DB
    - Table: projects (id, user_id, name, description, status)
    - Optional: project_tasks table (id, project_id, name, done flag)
[ ] Wire Projects page to real DB data (no more hard-coded projects)
[ ] Link projects to staches or items (future)
    - Maybe through tags, or a junction table

=== POLISH / CLEANUP ===
[ ] Do a quick pass on routes for consistency
    - /staches, /staches/new, /staches/<slug>, /staches/<slug>/edit
    - /items, /items/new, /items/<id>, /items/<id>/edit
[ ] Make sure all redirects land somewhere sensible (no dead ends)
[ ] Add “success” or “error” flash messaging (optional nice-to-have)
[ ] Commit all changes with a clear message:
    - "Add CRUD for items and staches; basic edit/delete flows"

Nice-to-haves (if you have extra time):
[ ] Add .btn.danger styling (global) for destructive actions
[ ] Add created_at / updated_at timestamps to Stache and Item tables
[ ] Small responsive tweaks for narrow windows / mobile
